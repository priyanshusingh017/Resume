# Motivation
I created this template as managing a resume on Google Docs was hard and changing any formatting was too difficult since it had to be applied in multiple places.

Most currently available templates either focus on two columns, or are multiple pages long that didn't work well for career fairs or online applications.

## Quick Start

Get started quickly using the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) template.
